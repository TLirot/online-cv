career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I started working in 2018, focusing my career on web development using frontend development technologies. I have always kept myself updated by using the latest versions of React, and currently Angular, as well as common libraries in frontend development like Jest, Redux, NgRx, and many others, both for Angular and React.

    Currently, my role is Senior Frontend Developer at Novatec-Gmbh, where I take on the responsibility of leading frontend development in the team, as well as mentoring and training my colleagues. 
    
    One of my most important values is the sense of teamwork, as well as creating a good environment, since the work atmosphere is everything in day-to-day life, and for me, it is a key point in feeling comfortable in my job.

    time: 2023 - Present
    company: Novatec - Gmbh, Granada
    details: |
      At Novatec, I worked on developing a post-sales application for a German automotive company. 
      This has allowed me to improve my tech stack, including working with Angular, as well as enabling me to make better 
      development decisions by knowing technologies like React and being able to choose the best from each and their way of 
      functioning to apply them to the project.

      I am currently the technical lead for the frontend part of the team I work with, while also mentoring my colleagues. This keeps me up to date with the new trends in frontend development.

      Being able to work with colleagues and clients from another country has allowed me to develop my work in both English and Spanish without any problems.
